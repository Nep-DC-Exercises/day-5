# Loops and Dictionaries

### Date: 9/4/2019

### Summary

One of the main points from today was to try and solve the exercises with the constraints present rather than immediately trying to jump to a more efficient solution. This helps solidify pros and cons of using different methods to solve problems. In the `leetspeak.py` exercise from yesterday, I should've used a while loop as that was the assignment but I decided to implement the easier solution.

The while loop method for decoding the leetspeak is present in todays exercises. In the `hotel_management.py` file, we got to see the versatility of the dictionary type and practiced how to store and retrieve data within a dictionary.
